## Almanakk

**Browse your database like an ancient reference book**

Navigate through your database by clicking foreign keys, just like following cross-references in an almanac. No SQL, no complex tools - just click and explore.

### What it does

Almanakk turns your database into a clickable, browsable book. Start at any table, click a foreign key value, and instantly navigate to that related record. Like Wikipedia for your database.
